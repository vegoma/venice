VENICE (an acronym for "Visualizer for Interactive Teaching of Climate Change in Schools") is an offline, interactive tool designed to teach climate change to students in both urban and rural schools. The primary goal of VENICE is to raise awareness among students about the effects of climate change in different regions, motivating them to engage in mitigation and adaptation actions.

Key Features of VENICE:
Interactive Visuals: VENICE provides maps and graphs to illustrate climate change effects in specific areas, such as the departments of Magdalena and Santander in Colombia. It focuses on key climate variables, including temperature, precipitation, and sea level changes.

Data Adaptation: The tool adapts the methodology of the German Climate Atlas for monitoring climate change, using maps and time series generated in Python. These show both historical and current climate data, expressed in absolute values and as anomalies relative to the climate normal (1981-2010).

Incorporation of Geographic Factors: It takes into account the altitude of stations to enhance the accuracy of the data and visual representations.

Interactive Book Format: The entire environment is compiled into an interactive book using Jupyter Notebooks, allowing students to engage directly with the data and visualizations.

By adapting existing tools and integrating them into an accessible format, VENICE aims to create an educational experience that visually and interactively demonstrates the local impacts of climate change, helping students understand its significance and encouraging them to take meaningful action.
